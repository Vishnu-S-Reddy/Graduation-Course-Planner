# Graduation-Course-Planner


Problem Statement:
A student needs to do 32 courses during his graduation. There is some dependency among the subjects.
Example for DS course prerequisite is C. Name the subjects as you wish and make a dependency graph.
Store this graph using adjacency list.
Write a program which helps student to determine the order in which he should take up the courses during his graduation.
He/She is allowed to take only 4 subjects per semester.



This is a project where we use topologic sorting to decide the order in which a student should take up the courses in order to able to complete all.
For example C is a pre-requisite for Data Structure.
Data Structures is a pre-requisite for Algorithms.
So we will show the order C-> Data Structures -> Algorithms.
